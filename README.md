ok so this is a cool project
i built if off a project i had created for jerk or a guy,
I wont name who he is but he wanted a BMS what was already available by the Chinese.
He bothered me and bothered me and so I create this .
To grow to jalapenos and some cool plants for my friends.

It’s a raspberry pi that’s it connected to an Arduino, yea I know sounds basic,
 But I started with an ESP8266 and found that it is so sensitive to power draw I changed platforms.
This thing would literally reset with a .10uf cap on rst and 47uf on vcc and gnd. What ever moved on.

I know this works I designed it before and its actually much better to live  with long term.

So yea..


Check the basic ass code out, have fun , don’t blame for me for indentation , Arduino IDE Is TRASH.
